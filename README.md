# football-match-prediction

This repository consists for a model to predict the outcome of weekly matches in the English Premier League . The notebook.ipynb consists of data exploration , feature selection and then calculating the accuracy and finally predicting the outcome using Logistic Regression , SVM , and XGBoost .

The DataAnalysis.ipynb file does data analysis on previous data from across all European leagues using the Kaggle dataset , which is in the form of sqlite.

The LSTM-copy1.ipynb file is used to calculate the outcome by training model using RNN based LSTMs .

The dataset was taken from www.football-data.co.uk
